# External Services
Allows creation of external services from within your rancherize.json.
This most notably allows to add [Healthcheck](../Healthcheck/README.md) and [PublishUrl](../PublishUrls/README.md)
configuration to the ExternalService which is not possible through the rancher ui at this point(version 1.5.9)

## Limitations
Services are not changed uppon pushes. You must delete the external service for changes to take effect.
I have added the option to call rancher-compose with `--force-upgrade` and adding the service names of the externals on
the `up` command but this does not change the external service.
If you know a way to achieve this please open an issue on [github](https://github.com/ipunkt/rancherize).

## Options
- external services are read from bellow the json array or object `external-services`
  - An array or numeric object variable name will result in the external service name `external-$NUMBER`
  - An non-numeric object vairable name will be used as external service name
- `ips`: array of ip addresses to point to
- `publish`: see [Publish Urls](../PublishUrls/README.md)
- `healthcheck`: see [Healthcheck](../Healthcheck/README.md)

## Example
```json
{
	"environments": {
		"envname": {
			"external-services":[
				{
					"ips":["192.168.2.1"],
					"publish":{ "url":"https:\/\/www.example.com\/" },
					"healthcheck":{ "url":"\/" }
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```
